# Car-Avoider
It's a simple SDL2 endless runner game where player changes road lanes to not collide with opponents' vehicles. The project was created using C++, SDL2, and two additional libraries: SDL_image and SDL_ttf.

The controls for the game are the keys 'A' and 'D' to move the car to the left lane and right lane respectively.
